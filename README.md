Hi, I’m Paula (she/her)! A student based in Madrid. I'm currently a graduate (BSc in Computational Biotechnology 🌱💻) pursuing my MSc in Data Science.  I’m interested and versed in data mining, machine learning and database management (SQL, NoSQL). I am currently learning more about REST APIs! I also enjoy art, reading, watching films and petting random dogs.

I am fluent in both Spanish and English, and I get by in Frech (it's a little rusty!). At the present time I'm studying German as a personal goal, after all... *warum nicht?*
