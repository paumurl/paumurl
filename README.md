Hi, I’m Paula (she/her)! A student based in Madrid. I'm a computational biotechnologist 🌱💻 now pursuing a MSc in Data Science. I’m interested and versed in data mining, machine learning and database management (SQL, NoSQL). I am currently learning more about REST APIs and MLOps! I also enjoy art, reading, watching films and petting random dogs.

I am fluent in both Spanish and English, and I get by in French (it's a little rusty!). At the present time I'm studying German as a personal goal, after all... *warum nicht?*
